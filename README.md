## DESCRIPTION
My motive for this project is to promote myself and showcase my skills.

I am creating a Portfolio for myself using the skills I aquire through my coding Bootcamp.

This project will help employers and others get to know me and my talents.

## LEARNED/LEARNING
During this project I gained a better understanding of flexbox and media queries.

## PROCESS/INSTALLTION
First, I created an HTMl file, followed by a CSS and added them to a repository. Then I added the "skeleton" to the HTML (doctype, html, head and body). Third I seperated the html into three sections and filled them with content. Then I styled the html with a CSS file. In the CSS, I styled the font-sizes, background colors, margin and paddings. After that, I adjusted the HTMl and added div tags to style the files using flexbox. Then, I added media queries to fit smaller screens. Finally I added background images to the project section.
